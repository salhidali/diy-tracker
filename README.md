# DIY Tracker

Being a DIYer, and a big fan of [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/) website, I wanted to have an app that, like instuctables, lets me keep track of my different projects.

I also, intend to add a timeline feature that shows each project evolution. 

Furthermore, I wanted, throughout this app, to be able to keep track of my budget (because who wants to go bankrupt following his hobbies ;))

Finally, I will add a chat, messaging service and a forum to enable user to interact with each others and come for help if needed.

Through this project, my goal is to use the best Java/Spring tools:
- Unit testing
- DBUnit testing
- Exception handling (ExceptionHandler, ControllerAdvice...)
- Proper logging (formatting logs, MDC)
- SpringSecurity (JWT)
- Actuators
- Using Gatling
- Websockets

This is an ongoing project. You will find below its evolution
